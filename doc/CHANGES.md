<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->

## 9.4.0 (2023-10-15)

## 9.3.0 (2023-09-30)
* fix [#1275](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1275) div scale support - Thank you [VincentMolinie](https://github.com/VincentMolinie) for implementing this

## 9.2.2 (2023-09-27)

## 9.2.1 (2023-09-20)
* fix _updateContainerHeight() to use height rather than min-height again (apart for nested grids which need it) and partial getComputedStyle CSS minHeight support

## 9.2.0 (2023-09-10)
* feat: nested grids now support `sizeToContent` to size themselves to how many sub items they contain - Thank you [@Helix](https://gridstackjs.slack.com/team/U05QT7G8H7T) for sponsoring this!
* fix [#2449](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2449) full grid maxRow fix

## 9.1.1 (2023-09-06)
* fix [#2435](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2435) directionCollideCoverage() tweaks
* fix resizeToContent() to handle node.h (using when cellHeight changes or we resize) vs DOM sizing (rest of the time)

## 9.1.0 (2023-09-04)
* renamed fitToContent to sizeToContent (API BREAK)
* feat: `sizeToContent` now supports being `boolean|number` to limit the height but user can resize past that, unlike maxH.
* feat: `resizeToContentParent` now on GridStackWidget for those widgets that need to resize differently.

## 9.0.2 (2023-08-29)
* fix 'resizecontent' event fix not called.
* partial fix [#2427](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2427) sizeToContent when calling cellHeight()/addWidget()/MakeWidget()

## 9.0.1 (2023-08-27)

* tweak to `sizeToContent` from [#2412](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/2412#issuecomment-1690219018). Thank you [@JonSohn](https://github.com/JonSohn)

## 9.0.0 (2023-08-23)
- feat [#404](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/404) added `GridStackOptions.sizeToContent` and `GridStackWidget.sizeToContent` to make gridItems size themselves to their content (no scroll bar), calling `GridStack.resizeToContent(el)` whenever the grid or item is resized.
- also added new `'resizecontent'` event, and `resizeToContentCB` and `resizeToContentParent` vars.
- fix [#2406](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2406) inf loop when autoPosition after loading into 1 column, then 2.

## 8.4.0 (2023-07-20)
* feat [#2378](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/2378) attribute `DDRemoveOpt.decline` to deny the removal of a specific class.
* fix: dragging onto trash now calls removeWidget() and therefore `GridStack.addRemoveCB` (for component cleanup)
* feat: `load()` support re-order loading without explicit coordinates (`autoPosition` or missing `x,y`) uses passed order.

## 8.3.0 (2023-06-13)
* feat [#2358](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2358) column(N, 'list'|'compact'|...) resizing now support reflowing content as list

## 8.2.3 (2023-06-11)
* fix [#2349](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2349) grid NoMove vs item NoMove support
* fix [#2352](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2352) .ui-draggable-dragging z-index for modal dialogs
* fix [#2357](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2357) NaN inf loop when using cellHeight rem/em
* fix [#2354](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2354) max-w cloning issue fix

## 8.2.1 (2023-05-26)
* fix: make sure `removeNode()` uses internal _id (unique) and not node itself (since we clone those often)
* fix: after calling `addRemoveCB` make sure we don't makeWidget() (incorrectly) a second time
* break: `GridStackWidget.id` is now string only (used to be numberOrString) as it causes usage to have to check and cast

## 8.2.0 (2023-05-24)
* feat: `makeWidget()` now take optional `GridStackWidget` for sizing
* fix: make sure `GridStack.saveCB` is call in `removeWidget()`
* feat: angular wrapper: serialize custom data support, and making sure destroy() is called on ng components

## 8.1.2 (2023-05-22)
* [#2323](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2323) module for Angular wrapper 

## 8.1.1 (2023-05-13)
* fix: [#2314](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2314) fix issue with having min-height/width instead of height/width for gs-h|x="1"
also further compressed CSS multi column rules (use `.gs-# > .grid-stack-item` instead of `.grid-stack-# > .grid-stack-item`)

## 8.1.0 (2023-05-06)
* break: remove `GridStackOptions.minWidth` obsolete since 5.1, use `oneColumnSize` instead
* optimize: CSS files now even 25% smaller (after being halfed in 8.0.0) by removing `.grid-stack` prefix for anything already gs based, and 3 digit rounding.
* fix: [#2275](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2275) `setupDragIn()` signature tweaks (HTMLElement | Document)
* feat: [#2205](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2205) added `GridStackOptions.draggable.cancel` for list of selectors that should prevent item dragging

## 8.0.1 (2023-04-29)
* feat: [#2275](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2275) `setupDragIn()` now can take an array or elements (in addition to selector string) and optional parent root (for shadow DOM support)
* fix: [#2234](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2234) `Utils.getElements('1')` (called by removeWidget() and others) now checks for digit 'selector' (becomes an id).
* fix: [#2213](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2213) `destroy()` now removes event handlers too
* feat: [#2292](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2292) ne nw resize handle
* break: (meant to be in v8) removed `GridStackOptions.dragInOptions` since `GridStack.setupDragIn()`has it replaced since 4.0

## 8.0.0 (2023-04-29)
* package is now ES2020 (TS exported files), webpack all.js still umd (better than commonjs for browsers), still have es5/ files unchanged (for now)
* optimize [#2243](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2243) removed `gs-min|max_w|h` attribute generated in CSS or written out as they are never used for rendering, only for initial load. This reduce our column/row CSS in half!
* optimize: removed `gs-w='1'` and `gs-h='1'` dom attribute writing since we already have min-width/min-height set, no need to set more attributes.
* optimize: remove `'ui-draggable'` and `'ui-resizable'` since wasn't used in CSS and we have the `-disabled` version when off (so we can use `not(xyz-disabled)`).
* add: `GridStack.saveCB` global callback for each item during save so app can insert any custom data before serializing it. `save()` can now be passed optional callback
* move: `GridStack.addRemoveCB` is now global instead of grid option. `load()` can still be passed different optional callback
* fix: addGrid() to handle passing an existing initialized grid already
* break: `GridStackOptions.subGrid` -> `GridStackOptions.subGridOpts`. We now have `GridStackWidget.subGridOpts` vs `GridStackNode.subGrid` (subclass) rather than try to merge the two at runtime since very different types...
* tons of improvements for Angular wrapper.

## 7.3.0 (2023-04-01)
* feat [#2229](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/2229) support nonce for CSP. Thank you [@jedwards1211](https://github.com/jedwards1211)
* feat: support nested grids with Angular component demo. Thank you R. Blanken for supporting this.
* fix [#2206](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2206) `load()` with collision fix
* fix [#2232](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2232) `autoPosition` bug loading from DOM

## 7.2.3 (2023-02-02)
* fix `addWidget()` to handle passing just {el} which was needed for Angular HMTL template demo
* add `opts.draggable.scroll` back to disable scrolling. Thank you [@VincentMolinie](https://github.com/VincentMolinie)

## 7.2.2 (2023-01-16)
* fix [#2171](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2171) `save()` nested grid has extra nested children & options
* regression for fix #2110: nested grids lost their styles causing wrong rendering when dragging to create sub nesting

## 7.2.1 (2023-01-14)
* fix [#2162](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/2162) removing item from a grid (into another) will now call `change` if anything was also modified during the remove
* fix [#2110](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2110) custom `GridStackOptions.itemClass` now works when dragging from outside

## 7.2.0 (2023-01-07)
* fix [#1936](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1936) some styles left behind after a drag
* remove [#1842](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1842) incorrect doc/partial code on widget resizeHandles
* doc [#2033](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2033) `resizestop` is actually correct as we don't animate resize today
* add - `init()`|`initAll()` will now load any listed children (what `addGrid()` already did)
* add - `GridStackOptions.addRemoveCB` which is use by frameworks (eg Angular) to dynamically create their gridItem components instead of regular div with class

## 7.1.2 (2022-12-29)
* fix [#939](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2039) 'prototype' undefined error for dd-gridstack.js
* add [#939](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2105) disable/enable are methods now recursive by default
* add better `GridStackEventHandlerCallback` spelled out types
* add We now have support for [Angular Component wrappers](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/tree/master/angular/) out of the box included in the build, with docs and demo! Need help to do that for React and Vue.

## 7.1.1 (2022-11-13)
* fix [#939](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/939) editable elements focus (regression in v6). Thank you [@Gezdy](https://github.com/Gezdy)

## 7.0.1 (2022-10-14)
* fix [#2073](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/2073) SSR (server side rendering) isTouch issue (regression in v6)
* fix - removing last item delete sub-grid that are not auto-generated (nested.html vs nested_advanced.html)

## 7.0.0 (2022-10-09)
* add [#1009](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1009) Create sub-grids on the fly,

## 4.0.0 (2021-3-19)

- fix [#149](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/149) [#1094](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1094) [#1605](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1605) [#1534](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1534) re-write of the **collision code - fixing 6 years old most requested request**
1. you can now swap items of the same size (vertical/horizontal) when grid is full, and is the default in `float:false` (top gravity) as it feels more natural. Could add Alt key for swap vs push behavior later.
2. Dragging up and down now behave the same (used to require push WAY down past to swap/append). Also much more efficient collision code.
3. handle mid point of dragged over items (>50%) rather than just a new row/column and check for the most covered item when multiple collide.

- fix [#393](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/393) [#1612](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1612) [#1578](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1578) re-write of the **drag in/out code - fixing 5 years old bug**
1. we now remove item when cursor leaves (`acceptWidgets` case using `dropout` event) or shape is outside (re-using same method) and re-insert on cursor enter (since we only get `dropover` event). Should **not be possible to have 2 placeholders** which confuses the grids.
2. major re-write and cleanup of the drag in/out. Vars have been renamed and fully documented as I couldn't understand the legacy buggy code.
3. removed any over trash delay feedback as I don't see the point and could introduce race conditions.

- fix [1617](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1617) FireFox DOM order issue. Thanks [@marcel-necker](https://github.com/marcel-necker)
- fix changing column # `column(n)` now resizes `cellHeight:'auto'` to keep square
- add [1616](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1616) `drag | resize` events while dragging. Thanks [@MrCorba](https://github.com/MrCorba)
- add [1637](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1637) `GridStack.setupDragIn()` so user can update external draggable after the grid has been created

## 3.3.0 (2021-2-2)

- big re-write on how `cellHeight()` works. you can now call it at any time (not just grid init options) including switching to 'auto' or other modes on the fly.
- fix `cellHeight:auto` now keeps cell square as window resizes (regressing from 2.x TS conversion). `Utils.throttle()` works better too (guaranteed to be called last event)
- new `cellHeight:initial` which makes the cell squares initially, but doesn't change as windows resizes (better performance)
- new grid option `cellHeightThrottle` (100ms) to control throttle of auto sizing triggers
- fix [1600](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1600) height too small with `cellHeight:auto` loading in 1 column. Now detect we load at 1 column and size accordingly (default 'auto' could make big 700x700 cells, so explicit px might still be wanted)
- fix [1538](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1538) loading nested into small size and sizing back up
- fix [1604](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1604) nested grid resizing fix
- fix [1599](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1599) resize from left side can move item right

## 3.2.0 (2021-1-25)

- fix [1413](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1413) website & lib works on mobile. We now compile the latest v1.0.8 `jquery.ui.touch-punch`
into the JQ version (only 2k) so mobile devices (android, iphone, ipad, ms surface, etc...) are supported out of the box.
HTML5 version will require re-write to plain `mousemove` & mobile `touchmove` instead of drag events in a future release.
- small optimizations (create placeholder content on the fly, moved more DD code into draggable class)

## 3.1.5 (2021-1-23)

- fix [1572](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1572) `column: N` option now sets CSS class
- fix [1571](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1571) don't allow drop when grid is full
- fix [1570](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1570) easier to drag out/in from below
- fix [1579](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1579) `cellHeight()` not updating CSS correctly
- fix [1581](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1581) H5 draggable by actual div handle rather than entire item (let content respond to drag as well)

## 3.1.4 (2021-1-11)

- fix [1535](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1535) use batchUpdate() around grid init to make sure gs-y attributes are respected.
- fix [1545](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1545) `disableMove()` correctly prevents drag later (remove events and draggable attribute)
- fix [1546](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1546) resize no longer delayed, which caused race conditions errors
- fix [1001](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1001) resizing near bottom/top needs to auto-scroll/. thanks [@hbcarlos](https://github.com/hbcarlos)!

## 3.1.2 (2020-12-7)

- fix [1419](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1419) dragging into a fixed row grid works better (check if it will fit, else try to append, else won't insert)
-- **possible BREAK** (unlikely you use engine directly)
* engine constructor takes Options struct rather than spelling arguments (easier to extend/use)
* `canBePlacedWithRespectToHeight()` -> `willItFit()` like grid method

- fix [1330](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1330) `maxW` does not work as intended with resizable handle `"w"`
- fix [1472](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1472) support all options for new dragged in widgets (read all `gs-xyz` attributes)
- fix [1511](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1511) dragging any grid item content works
- fix [1438](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1438) web-component fixes & grid with 0 size initially.

## 3.1.0 (2020-12-4)

- add new `addGrid(parent, opts)` to create a grid and load children instead of `init() + load()`, which is used by `load()` to supports nested grids creation.
see [nested.html](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/tree/master/demo/nested.html) demo.
- `save()` will now work on nested grids, recursively saving info. added flag to also allow saving the current grid options + children
(needed for nested grids) so you can now call new `adddGrid()` to re-create everything from JSON.
- fix [1505](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1505) don't call `movable()`/`resizable()` on locked items error. thanks [@infime](https://github.com/infime)
- fix [1517](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1517) force typescript 3.6 as 3.7 has breaking change

## 3.0.0 (2020-11-29)

- the big news is we finally have a native HTML5 drag&drop plugin (zero jquery)! Huge thanks to [@rhlin](https://github.com/rhlin) for creating this in stealth mode. Read all about it in main doc.
- we now have a React example, in addition to Vue - Angular is next!. thanks [@eloparco](https://github.com/eloparco)
- fix placeholder not having custom `GridStackOptions.itemClass`. thanks [@pablosichert](https://github.com/pablosichert)
- fix [1484](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1484) dragging between 2 grids and back (regression in 2.0.1) 
- fix [1471](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1471) `load()` into 1 column mode doesn't resize back to 12 correctly
- fix [1235](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1235) `update(el, opts)` re-write to take all `GridStackWidget` options (not just x,y,width,height) and do everything efficiently.
Hiding `locked()`, `move()`, `resize()`, `minWidth()`, etc... as they just simply call update() which does all the constrain now as well!
- del `ddPlugin` grid option as we only have one drag&drop plugin at runtime, which is defined by the include you use (HTML5 vs jquery vs none)
- change attribute `data-gs-min-width` is now `gs-min-w`. We removed 'data-' from all attributes, and shorten 'width|height' to just 'w|h' to require less typing and more efficient (2k saved in .js alone!) [1491](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1491) [1492](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1492)
- also `GridStackWidget` used in most API `width|height|minWidth|minHeight|maxWidth|maxHeight` are now shorter `w|h|minW|minH|maxW|maxH` as well [1493](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1493)
- **** see [migrating to v3](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js#migrating-to-v3) ****

- add `data-gs-static-grid` attribute
- fix [1435](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1435) `class="ui-draggable-disabled ui-resizable-disabled"` have been added back to static grid items, so existing CSS rule to style continue working 
- fix [1439](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1439) getting DOM element by id with number works (api that uses `GridStackElement` handle more string formats)
- fix [1442](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1442) setting `marginTop` (or any 4 sides) to cause resize to break. Thanks [@deadivan](https://github.com/deadivan) for suggested fix.

## 2.1.0 (2020-10-28)

- fix grid `static: true` to no longer add any drag&drop (even disabled) which should speed things up, and `setStatic(T/F)` will now correctly add it back/delete for items that need it only. 
Also fixed JQ draggable warning if not initialized first [858](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/858)
- add `addWidget(opt)` now handles just passing a `GridStackWidget` which creates the default divs, simplifying your code. Old API still supported.
- add `save(saveContent = true)` now lets you optionally save the HTML content in the node property, with load() restoring it [1418](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1418)
- add `GridStackWidget.content` now lets you add any HTML content when calling `load()/save()` or `addWidget()` [1418](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1418)

including a custom function for you to create the new layout [1332](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1332)

## 2.0.2 (2020-10-05)

- fix `animate` to not re-create CSS style each time (should be faster too) and made it default now since so much nicer. pass `{animate: false}` grid options if you want instant again [937](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/937)
- fix `resizable: { handles: ...}` forcing `alwaysShowResizeHandle` behavior [1373](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1373)

## 2.0.1 (2020-09-26)

- fix `minWidth()`, `minHeight()`, `maxHeight()` to set node value as well [1359](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1359)
- fix `GridStackOptions` spelling [1359](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1359)

- fix 2 drop shadows when dragging between grids [393](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/393)

## 2.0.0 (2020-09-07)

- re-write to native Typescript, removing all JQuery from main code and API (drag&drop plugin still using jqueryui for now)
- add `getGridItems()` to return list of HTML grid items
- add `{dragIn | dragInOptions}` grid attributes to handle external drag&drop items
- add `save()` and `load()` to serialize grids from JSON, saving all attributes (not just w,h,x,y) [1286](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1286)
- add `margin` to replace `verticalMargin` which affects both dimensions in code, rather than one in code the other in CSS.
You can now have perfect square cells (default) [723](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/723)
- fix [1299](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1299) many columns round-off error
- fix [1102](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1102) loose functionality when they are moved to a new grid

- fix [1217](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1217) If I set cellHeight to some vh, only first grid will take vh, rest will use px
- include SASS source files to npm package again [1193](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1193)

## 1.1.0 (2020-02-29)

- add `minRow` and `row` grid options (which set minRow=maxRow=N) [1172](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1172) - thanks [@RadoiAndrei](https://github.com/RadoiAndrei)
- fix [1166](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1166) resize not taking margin height into account - thanks [@awjae](https://github.com/awjae)
- fix [1155](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1155) `maxRow` now limit initial item placement if out of bound, preventing broken drag behavior
- fix [1171](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1171) added event support to call `grid.on('added removed change', callback)` again even with native events.

## v1.0.0 (2020-02-23)

- **breaking**: [(1084)](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1084) jquery was removed from the API and dependencies (initialize differently, and methods take/return `GridStack` or `HTMLElement` instead of `JQuery`), so your code will need to change. 
See [Migrating to v1.0.0](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/tree/master/README.md#migrating-to-v100)
- `setColumn(N)` is now `column(N)` (matches other set/get methods) and `getColumn()` to get current column number
- add `grid.on(eventName, callback)` / `grid.off(eventName)` to hide native JQ events mix
- add `grid.getRow()` to get the current grid row number

## v0.6.4 (2020-02-17)

- fix [#540](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/540) WebComponent support: CSS file now insert before grid instead of 'head'
- fix [#1143](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1143) nested grids with different `acceptWidgets` class
- fix [#1142](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1142) add/remove widget will also trigger change events when it should.
- optimized `change` callback to save original x,y,w,h values and only call those that changed [1148](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1148)
- delete `bower` since [dead](https://snyk.io/blog/bower-is-dead) for a while now

## v0.6.3 (2020-02-05)

- fix [#1132](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/1132) oneColumnMode missing CSS to do layout
- del `oneColumnModeClass` / `.grid-stack-one-column-mode` and associated code. If you depended on this, use class `.grid-stack-1` instead since it is 1 column layout anyway [1134](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1134)

## v0.6.2 (2020-02-03)

- add `oneColumnModeDomSort` true|false to let you specify a custom layout (use dom order instead of x,y) for oneColumnMode `column(1)` [#713](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/713)
- fix oneColumnMode to only restore if we auto went to it as window sizes up [#1125](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1125)
- editing in 1 column (or few columns) does a better job updating higher layout (track before and after and move items accordingly). 
Tracking item swap would be even better still. [#1127](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1127)

## v0.6.1 (2020-02-02)

- fix [#37](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/37) oneColumnMode (<768px by default) now simply calls `column(1)` and remembers prev columns (so we can restore). This gives
us full resize/re-order of items capabilities rather than a locked CSS only layout (see prev rev changes). [#1120](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1120)
- fix [responsive.html](https://gridstackjs.com/demo/responsive.html) demo [#1121](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1121)

## v0.6.0 (2019-12-24)

- add `float(val)` to set/get the grid float mode, which will relayout [#1088](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1088)
- add `compact()` to reclaim any empty space and relayout grid items [#1101](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1101)
- add `options.dragOut` to let user drag nested grid items out of a parent or not (default false)
and jQuery UI `draggable.containment` can now be specified in options. You can now drag&drop between 2 nested grids [#1105](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1105)
- add `%` as a valid unit for height [#1093](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1093). thank you 
[@trevisanweb](https://github.com/trevisanweb) [@aureality](https://github.com/aureality)
[@ZoolWay](https://github.com/ZoolWay)
- fix callbacks to get either `added, removed, change` or combination if adding a node require also to change its (x,y) for example.
Also you can now call `batchUpdate()` before calling a bunch of `addWidget()` and get a single event callback (more efficient).
[#1096](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1096)
- `removeAll()` is now much faster (no relayout) and calls `removed` event just once with a list [#1097](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1097)
- `column()` complete re-write and is no longer "Experimental". We now do a reasonable job at sizing/position the widgets (especially 1 column) and
also now cache each column layout so you can go back to say 12 column and not loose original layout. [#1098](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1098)
- fix `addWidget(el)` (no data) would not render item at correct location, and overlap item at (0,0) [#1098](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1098)
- you can now pre-define size of dragable elements from a sidebar using standard `data-gs-width` and `data-gs-height` - fix 
[#413](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/413), [#914](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/914), [#918](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/918), 
[#922](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/922), [#933](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/issues/933) 
thanks [@ermcgrat](https://github.com/ermcgrat) and others for pointing out code issue.

## v0.5.5 (2019-11-27)

- min files include rev number/license [#1075](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1075)
- npm package fix to exclude more temporary content [#1078](https://github.com/gridstack/gridstack.js/pull/1078)
